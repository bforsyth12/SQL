For this project, I am querying data from several tables to quantify customer and order metrics.

--1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT Count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID<>'Order ID';

--2. How many of those order were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID';

--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February
SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=Feb.orderID
WHERE LENGTH(orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID';

--4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

--5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as Revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(quantity)
, SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue
, product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 times in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum), ROUND(AVG(FebSales.quantity*price),2) AS average_price 
FROM BIT_DB.customers
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
WHERE Quantity>2
AND length (orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'OrderID';

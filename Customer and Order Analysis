For this project, I am querying data from several tables to quantify customer and order metrics.

--1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT Count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID<>'Order ID';

--2. How many of those order were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID';

--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February
SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=Feb.orderID
WHERE LENGTH(orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID';

--4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

--5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as Revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(quantity)
, SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue
, product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 times in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum), ROUND(AVG(FebSales.quantity*price),2) AS average_price 
FROM BIT_DB.customers
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
WHERE Quantity>2
AND length (orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'OrderID';

--8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;

--Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?
SELECT distinct location
, COUNT(orderID) as Number_of_orders
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location like '%NY%'
AND length (orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'OrderID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID)>2;

--How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT Product
, SUM(quantity) as Number_sold
FROM FebSales
WHERE product like '%Headphones%'
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Number_sold DESC;

--What was the average amount spent per account in February?
SELECT ROUND(AVG(quantity*price),2) as AVG_amount_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
Left JOIN customers cust
ON Feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE length (orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'OrderID';

--What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?
SELECT SUM(quantity)/COUNT(cust.acctnum) as AVG_quantity_purchased
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
Left JOIN customers cust
ON Feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE length (orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'OrderID';

--Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT product
, SUM(quantity*price) as total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC LIMIT 1;

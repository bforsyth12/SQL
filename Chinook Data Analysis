This is a project using Chinook digital media.  I used various data (customers, employees, invoices, info about digital media) to conduct analyses and gain insight 
into meaningful information that would support the company's success.

--Which employee has the most customers?
SELECT employees.Employeeid, employees.FirstName, employees.LastName, COUNT(customers.CustomerId) AS Number_of_Customers
FROM chinook.employees
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers
ON employees.Employeeid=customers.SupportRepId
GROUP BY employees.Employeeid
ORDER BY Number_of_Customers DESC;

--What is the revenue for each genre?
SELECT genres.name 
, SUM(invoice_items.UnitPrice*invoice_items.Quantity) AS TotalRevenue
FROM chinook.genres
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks
ON genres.Genreid=tracks.Genreid
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoice_items
ON tracks.Trackid=invoice_items.Trackid
